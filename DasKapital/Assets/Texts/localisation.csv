SCE_001,What is exploitation ?
SCE_002,"When people talk about exploitation in public, they tend to be pretty left leaning."
SCE_003,"But beyond the obvious cases of rights infrigement we hear about from time to time, the accusation of exploitation is thrown around even in cases where a majority might not see any problem."
SCE_004,But why is that ? Is it simply outrage for the sake of outrage ? Or are people woking with different definitions of exploitation ?
SCE_005,"In an attempt to answer that question, we'll have to start with a pretty basic definition of what most people mean by ""exploitation""."
SCE_006,Exploitation is the taking of profit at the disadvantage of someone else.
